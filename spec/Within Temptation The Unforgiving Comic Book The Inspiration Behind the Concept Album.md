The comic book also features references and Easter eggs from other songs and albums by Within Temptation. For instance, the name of Mother Maiden's organization is The Unforgiving, which is also the name of their fourth album. The name of Disciple's cult is The Silent Force, which is also the name of their third album. The name of one of Disciple's victims is Sharon, which is also the name of the lead singer of Within Temptation. The name of one of Mother Maiden's wraiths is Robert, which is also the name of the guitarist and founder of Within Temptation.
 
The Unforgiving comic book is a brilliant example of how music and comics can work together to create a compelling and immersive story. It showcases the talent and creativity of Within Temptation and their collaborators, and it offers a new perspective on their music. It is a treat for fans and newcomers alike, and it deserves a place in any comic book collection.
