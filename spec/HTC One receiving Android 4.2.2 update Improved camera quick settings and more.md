The Android 4.2.2 update for the HTC One adds some of the features that were missing from the previous version, such as lock screen widgets, quick settings panel, and Daydream mode. It also improves the performance and stability of the device, as well as fixes some bugs and issues.
 
One of the most noticeable changes in the update is the revamped Sense UI, which now offers more customization options and features. For instance, users can now choose between three different home screen launchers: BlinkFeed, traditional grid, or alphabetical list. They can also change the icons and widgets on the lock screen, as well as access Google Now by swiping up from the home button.
 
The update also enhances some of the HTC One's unique features, such as Zoe camera mode, which now allows users to share their photos and videos on Instagram and other social networks. The HTC Share feature, which lets users create and share online albums of their Zoe shots, has also been improved with more editing options and themes.
 
The Android 4.2.2 update for the HTC One is currently available for download over the air in some European countries, such as UK, France, Germany, and Spain. Users can check for the update by going to Settings > About > Software updates on their devices. HTC has not announced when the update will be available in other regions or on other carriers.
