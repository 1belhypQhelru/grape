## How to prevent TeamSpeak 3 server admin token hacks?
 
If you are a TeamSpeak 3 server owner or administrator, you may want to prevent hackers from stealing your admin tokens and abusing your server. Here are some tips to protect your server from admin token hacks:

- Use a strong and unique password for your query login. Do not share it with anyone or store it in plain text.
- Change your query port from the default 10011 to a random and obscure one. This will make it harder for hackers to find and connect to your query interface.
- Limit the access to your query interface by using firewall rules or IP whitelists. Only allow trusted IP addresses or devices to use the query interface.
- Disable the token creation feature in your server settings. This will prevent anyone from creating new tokens without your permission.
- Monitor your server logs and activity regularly. Look for any suspicious or unauthorized actions or connections on your server.
- Delete any unused or expired tokens from your server. Do not keep them as backups or for future use.
