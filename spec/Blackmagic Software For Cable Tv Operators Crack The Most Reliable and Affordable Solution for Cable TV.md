## What can you do with ATEM Television Studio?
 
With ATEM Television Studio, you can switch between multiple sources such as cameras, computers, video players and graphics. You can also apply transitions, effects and keys to create dynamic and engaging live shows. For example, you can use chroma key to replace green screen backgrounds with virtual sets, or use picture-in-picture to show multiple sources on screen at the same time. You can also overlay graphics such as logos, titles, lower thirds and bugs using the media player.
 
ATEM Television Studio also lets you mix audio from your sources using the built-in Fairlight audio mixer. You can adjust levels, EQ, compression and more for each channel. You can also add external audio sources such as microphones or music players using the XLR or RCA inputs.
 
ATEM Television Studio also lets you stream your live program to the internet using popular platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitch. You can use the Ethernet port to connect to your network or use a USB webcam output to connect to your computer. You can also record your program to an external device such as a hard drive or an SD card using the HDMI or SDI outputs.
 
## How do you control ATEM Television Studio?
 
You can control ATEM Television Studio using the front panel buttons or the included free ATEM Software Control for Mac or Windows. The software gives you more control and creative options than the hardware panel. You can switch video sources live, load the media pool with graphics, use transitions and keys, change switcher settings and mix audio. You can also control and color correct your cameras via the SDI connection to any Blackmagic Studio Camera or URSA Broadcast.[^2^]
 
For larger live productions, you can even run multiple copies of the software so that more than one person can work on the show at the same time. For example, one person can switch video sources while another person handles graphics and audio.[^1^]
