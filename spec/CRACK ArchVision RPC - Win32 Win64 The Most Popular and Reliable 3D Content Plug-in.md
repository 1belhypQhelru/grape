ArchVision RPC is a technology that allows architects to use realistic and intelligent 3D models of people, cars, vegetation, furniture and other objects in their design projects. RPC stands for Rich Photorealistic Content, which means that each RPC is a bundle of complex geometry, physically based materials and lights that can be customized and animated according to the user's needs. RPCs can be easily integrated into various applications such as Enscape, V-Ray, Twinmotion, Unreal Engine and more with the help of AVAIL, a content management system that enables drag and drop functionality. ArchVision also offers RPC channels from exclusive partners such as Laubwerk and Renderpeople, as well as the ability to create your own RPCs with FOVEA, a content creation tool.
 
In this article, we will explore the features and benefits of ArchVision RPC, as well as how to use it in your workflow. We will also show you some examples of RPCs in action and how they can enhance your visualization projects.

## What is ArchVision RPC?
 
ArchVision RPC is a patented technology that has been developed by ArchVision, a company that specializes in 3D model platforms for architects. ArchVision was founded in 1991 by Randall Stevens, an architect who wanted to create a better way of adding realistic entourage to his designs. He came up with the idea of using image-based representations of 3D models that could be easily placed and manipulated in any scene. This led to the creation of RPC, which has since evolved into a smart and responsive content platform that can adapt to different rendering engines and environments.

An RPC is not just a static image or a simple 3D model. It is a bundle of data that contains information about the geometry, materials, lights and parameters of an object. For example, an RPC car can have different paint colors, license plates, reflections and animations that can be controlled by the user. An RPC person can have different poses, clothing styles, facial expressions and movements that can be customized by the user. An RPC tree can have different seasons, leaf colors, wind effects and growth stages that can be adjusted by the user.
 
RPCs are designed to be platform-agnostic, which means that they can work with any application that supports them. ArchVision has developed plugins for various applications such as Autodesk Revit, 3ds Max, SketchUp, AutoCAD, Rhino and more. These plugins allow users to access and place RPCs directly from their design software. Users can also use AVAIL, a content management system that works with ArchVision's cloud service to store and organize their RPCs. AVAIL enables users to drag and drop any RPC into their scene with ease.
 
## What are the benefits of ArchVision RPC?
 
ArchVision RPC offers many benefits for architects who want to create realistic and engaging visualizations for their projects. Some of these benefits are:
 
- **Quality:** RPCs are high-quality 3D models that are based on real-world objects and scanned data. They have realistic textures, materials and lighting effects that make them look natural and convincing in any scene.
- **Performance:** RPCs are optimized for rendering speed and efficiency. They use image-based representations that reduce the polygon count and memory usage of the scene. They also use level-of-detail (LOD) techniques that adjust the resolution and complexity of the models depending on the distance from the camera.
- **Variety:** RPCs offer a wide range of content options for different types of projects. Users can choose from over 2,500+ legacy RPCs that include people, cars, vegetation, furniture and other objects. Users can also access over 260 new prime RPCs that are more intelligent and responsive than the legacy ones. Users can also subscribe to exclusive channels from partners such as Laubwerk and Renderpeople that offer high-quality plants and human models.
- **Customization:** RPCs are flexible and adaptable to the user's needs. Users can change various parameters such as color, size, orientation, animation and more with just a few clicks. Users can also create their own RPCs with FOVEA, a content creation tool that allows users to import their own models or use existing ones from ArchVision's library.
- **Integration:** RPCs are 8cf37b1e13
