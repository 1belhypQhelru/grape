The plot is simple: a tampon lands in a puddle of alien blood after a UFO crashes near a school. Carmen, a bullied student, finds the tampon and inserts it, unaware of its origin. She immediately mutates into a monstrous creature with superpowers and a hunger for destruction. She goes on a rampage, killing and injuring her classmates and teachers. A group of students, led by Tom, decides to fight back and stop her with whatever weapons they can find.
 
The film is only 3 minutes long, but it packs a lot of action, comedy and gore. The special effects are impressive, especially for a low-budget production. The actors do a great job of delivering the absurd lines and situations with a straight face. The film also features a cameo by Tom Beck, a famous German actor and singer, as Prof. Jackson, who tries to explain the alien invasion to the students.
 
Alien Tampon is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. It is full of blood, violence, profanity and sexual innuendo. It is also very funny and entertaining, if you enjoy this kind of humor. The film has won several awards at film festivals and has been praised by critics and fans alike. It has also spawned a fan campaign to turn it into a feature-length movie.
 
If you want to watch Alien Tampon, you can find it on YouTube[^1^] or on the official production site[^2^]. You can also follow the film on Facebook[^2^] for updates and news. Be warned: once you see it, you will never look at tampons the same way again.

Alien Tampon is not only a fun and crazy short film, but also a potential source of inspiration for aspiring filmmakers. The film was made by a team of students from the Filmakademie Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, one of the most prestigious film schools in Germany. They used crowdfunding to raise money for the production and managed to create a professional-looking film with limited resources. They also used social media and viral marketing to promote the film and reach a wide audience.
 
The film shows that with creativity, passion and teamwork, anyone can make a film that stands out and gets noticed. The filmmakers behind Alien Tampon have proven that they have talent and vision, and they deserve to have their film turned into a full-length feature. They have already written a script for the movie version, which would expand the story and the characters, and introduce new elements and twists. They are currently looking for investors and partners to make their dream come true.
