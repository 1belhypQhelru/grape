## Watercolor Painting Tips for Beginners
  
If you are new to watercolor painting, you might want to learn some basic watercolor techniques and tips that will help you improve your skills and confidence. Here are some of them:
  
- Use good quality watercolor paper that can absorb the water and pigment without buckling or tearing. You can also tape your paper to a board to keep it flat and prevent it from curling.
- Use two jars of water: one for rinsing your brush and one for applying clean water to your painting. Change your water frequently to avoid muddy colors.
- Experiment with different brushes and sizes. You will need a large brush for covering large areas and a small brush for details and edges. You can also try different shapes and materials of brushes, such as round, flat, synthetic or natural.
- Learn how to control the amount of water and paint on your brush. Water dilutes the paint and makes it more transparent and fluid. You can use a paper towel to blot excess water or paint from your brush before applying it to your paper.
- Learn how to mix colors on your palette or on your paper. You can create different shades and tones by adding more or less water or paint. You can also blend colors on your paper by applying wet paint over wet paint or wet paint over dry paint.
- Learn how to use different watercolor techniques, such as wet on dry, wet on wet, flat wash, graded wash, dry brushing, lifting off, bleeding, layering, masking and more. Each technique has its own effect and purpose in creating a watercolor painting.

Watercolor painting is a fun and rewarding hobby that anyone can enjoy. With JixiPix Watercolor Studio 1.4.5 and some basic watercolor techniques, you can create beautiful paintings from any photo in minutes.
